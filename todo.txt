 - Create a "Start with X data" drop down
 - Create a way to load data from file or database
 - Save button that saves current map to database with custom edit URL
   - Save function should choose semi-random slug? (Sequential letters, how should it work?)
 - Edit URL should be some combination of the slug and a secret/salted key
 - Add view map page that is just the slug (like http://mappy.io/map/aBcD)
 - Figure out how to let users type in a country or state for map locaiton... auto complete or something? Every location could be stored in the DB that way?
 - Add all other map options
 - Handle 3rd column for marker mode
 - Add logo/link on top of map or somewhere on map page (can embed on SVG?)

Interface:
 - Edit/Delete link (SAVE THIS LINK, or you won't be able to access this page later)
 - Direct link to Map
 - Embed code
 - Delete this map


 - Google Analytics
 - Choose/buy domain
 - Download JPG/SVG? 
 - Save to specific url
